    "description": "I'm currently working with a team of 6 engineers building MIIMETIQ COMPOSER, a framework for building private IoT solutions used by the biggest companies in the Industry 4.0. The product is built around microservices using Python, Go and Node.js, and although I also like to help developing some backend code, my primary role on the team is developing new features on the various frontends of the product. We mainly do it using React, Redux, Redux Loop and Typescript, but we use all kind of libraries for each frontend. We follow a very functional, monadic and domain driven architecture based on ELM."
